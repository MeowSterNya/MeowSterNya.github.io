I am 18 year old male who graduated from the Bishops' High School and is now a second-year <strong>Computer Science</strong> student at the <strong>University of Guyana</strong>. I'm passionate about aviation and cars and learning new languages. I am currently studying the Japanese and Korean languages and plan to soon visit South Korean for a holiday vacation. My goal is the one day become a pilot, so I use my free time to learn about the history, practices and development of the aviation industry. I have been practicing with flight simulation software since 2011 and am now very knowledgeable with the operation of aircrafts. I enjoy taking photographs of Landscapes, Nature, listening to music, watching Korean Drama, watching Anime, drawing and 3D modeling artworks.
