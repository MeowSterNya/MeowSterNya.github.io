          <p>Throughout my life I had a strong dislike for drawing because I could not draw, but in my 4<sup>th</sup> year of high school, I forced myself to draw something and ever since I have liked drawing, granted I do not think my drawings are any good but Iâ€™m still proud of the fact I can now draw and express myself through art. My love for computers led me to want to express my art digitally as well as i could with pen and paper, this led me to meet friends that introduced me to digital editing softwares, such as: <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Cinema 4D</strong> and <strong>AutoCad.</strong> I also picked up the skill of computer repairs, maintance, server and also network management. </p>
